 *
 * This project is an implementation of a very lightweight command-line options
 * parser. It is capable of interpreting the Unix/GNU style command line
 * argument flags. It is designed to be platform independent and can be used as
 * a static library or directly as source.
 *
 * The library is designed to work like something of a database for your
 * command line. At initialization time you feed in the arguments vector (your
 * data records) and a list of option definitions (your schema). The library
 * then parses the options and stores them internally for querying later.
 * Several querying functions are provided that cover the most common use cases
 * for options handling.
 *
 * All of the query functions take an option name and an option tag as
 * parameters. These two arguments will be used to search the list of parsed
 * options for any that match both parameters. In some cases only one of the
 * parameters is needed for a query. To facilitate this, the query functions
 * will interpret a NULL pointer to match everything. An example of this would
 * be selecting all parsed options with the tag "foo":
 *
 * const char** foo_lst = opts_select(NULL,"foo");
 *
 * In the example above, the NULL would match *all* parsed options and from that
 * group only those having the tag "foo" would be returned. Another common
 * scenario would be searching by parameter name:
 *
 * const char** includes = opts_select("I", NULL);
 *
 * In this scenario all of the options that were parsed having the name 'I'
 * would be returned regardless of their tag value. This would equate to all of
 * the instances of '-I' that would occur on the command line for an invocation
 * of gcc.
 *
 * With this design you should be able to let the library handle your options
 * parsing while you focus on your application logic using appropriate queries
 * to change behavior where necessary.
